    <h3>Description</h3>

    <br>

    <p>To make a classic lasagna, start by preparing the meat sauce by sautéing onion and garlic in olive oil until fragrant, then add 500g of ground beef and cook until browned.
         Stir in crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano,
          and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Let it simmer for 30 minutes.
           In a bowl, mix 500g of ricotta cheese with an egg, Parmesan, salt, and pepper until smooth.
            Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. 
            Layer lasagna noodles, followed by ricotta mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Repeat until all ingredients are used, 
            finishing with mozzarella and Parmesan on top. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then uncover and bake for 15-20 minutes until 
            golden and bubbly. Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
